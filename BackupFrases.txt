Trump is the president of America
Donald Trump is the president of America
She is the teacher
This is the best movie making
The musician is at the music store
The car is at the garage
The English class is on Monday
The babies are tired
She is the Queen
You are the teacher
He is a person
She is a Vegetarian
The band is at the Abbey Road
This house is central
FIFA is the Football Organization
The politicians are outdated
She is the nurse
John is the City Mayor
She is the actress
The day is sunny
The question is easy
The mother has five children
My left arm is broken
She is in High School
The tennis match is on
The politicians are outdated
The babies are tired
